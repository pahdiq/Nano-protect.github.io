        Our company uses a specialized particle called a "Copper Nano-particle" to protect you and your family. <br>
        The way this product works is extremely simple in design, but wil save lives. <br>
        "Copper-Nanoparticles" are very small pieces of copper. to give you an idea on the general size, <br> 
        if you took something the size of your pinky nail, and cut it into a million slices, you would have <br>
        one million nano-particles! These particles kill any germs they come in contact with! <br>
        Using a simple mechanized sprayer, we can apply these particles intermixed with water. <br>
        Once the water evaporates, the particles are left behind, leaving a barrier of protection! <br>
